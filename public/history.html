                </span>Forms of Globalisation</h3>
            &nbsp;The direct origins of globalisation span to the dawn of human history; globalisation is becoming more
            interconnected and it has been happening forever. However globalisation has become significantly more
            prominent in the last millenia than ever before. The silk and spice roads were some of the most important
            early forms of globalisation as they allowed the European and Asian continents to make initial contact and
            later learn different techniques from one another. These early forms of globalisation allowed unification
            between the two continents which for the most part benefited humanity. The Columbian exchange is yet another
            important event in the history of globalisation as it introduced the European people to the Indigenous
            population of the Americas; despite the two cultures making contact it had an undoubtedly negative impact on
            the native population and their overall quality of life. For example some diseases such as smallpox brought
            over by the Europeans absolutely devastated the indigenous population with an estimated ninety-five percent
            of the population being wiped out. Globalism had another major increase throughout the late 19th and early
            20th centuries with events such as the industrial revolution creating trade and manufacturing agreements
            between countries leading to a more interdependent world. During the first World War the United States of
            America did not engage in direct combat until the later stages of the war and instead began supplying
            European countries with resources such as ammunition to use in battle causing interdependence between Europe
            and the US. After the war the US helped Europe rebuild under the condition that all materials used were
            purchased from US companies.
