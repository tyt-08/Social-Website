            <p>
                &nbsp;The direct origins of globalisation span to the dawn of human history; globalisation is becoming
                more interconnected and it has been happening forever.
                However globalisation has become significantly
                more prominent in the last millenia than ever before.

                &nbsp;The silk and spice roads were some of the most
                important early forms of globalisation as they allowed the European and Asian continents to make initial
                contact and later learn different techniques from one another. These early forms of globalisation
                allowed unification between the two continents which for the most part benefited humanity. The Columbian
                exchange is yet another important event in the history of globalisation as it introduced the European
                people to the Indigenous population of the Americas; despite the two cultures making contact it had an
                undoubtedly negative impact on the native population and their overall quality of life. For example some
                diseases such as smallpox brought over by the Europeans absolutely devastated the indigenous population
                with an estimated ninety-five percent of the population being wiped out. Globalism had another major
                increase throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries with events such as the industrial revolution
                creating trade and manufacturing agreements between countries leading to a more interdependent world.
                <img src="assets/industrial revolution.jpg" loading="lazy" class="intext-img">
                &nbsp;During the first World War the United States of America did not engage in direct combat until the
                later
                stages of the war and instead began supplying European countries with resources such as ammunition to
                use in battle causing interdependence between Europe and the US. After the war the US helped Europe
                rebuild under the condition that all materials used were purchased from US companies. This led to an
                economic boom in the US granting them wealth unseen in history until the 1920â€™s when the great
                depression hit. The great depression ruined the global economy due to the world being dependent on the
                US and their products. From the second world war onward globalism has been used as a method to avoid
                another world war and remove the gap between wealthy and poor nations by supporting countries with less
                wealth.
