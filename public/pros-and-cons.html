                Effects does Globalisation Have?</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;Globalism comes with both upsides and downsides. Becoming more interdependent on one another can
                have massive benefits such as a more peaceful world, however becoming more interdependent can cause
                problems for the individual and local communities. Globalism can lead to more distributed wealth
                throughout the world and help save people from poverty. According to the president of the World Bank
                over a billion people have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty and that global poverty is at a
                lower rate than ever before. Despite helping impoverished people, globalism has ruined local economies
                by flooding the market with cheap external goods that can be imported cheaper than local companies can
                produce. The result of the imports is a decreased quality of life because local manufacturers shut down
                as they are unable to compete with the large transnational corporations leading to a decrease in job
                opportunities which leaves the citizens poorer. Globalism allows certain things such as the internet to
                work which improves the quality of life for people with access to technology; for those without access
                to modern technology it proves no real benefit and instead adds to the gap between rich and poor. For
                the typical person in a developed country globalisation plays a massive role on the quality of life and
                from the perspective of someone within a developed country it would seem to be a positive thing. It
                provides them with companies such as amazon which allows them to ship nearly anything to their doorstep.
                It would also give them access to foods and products from outside their country. For example, in Canada
                there are a multitude of American owned businesses like McDonalds which without globalisation would not
                be able to operate within the country. To summarise, globalisation has a better effect on the quality of
                life of someone within a developed country compared to a citizen of a developing country.
