      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">What <span style="font-weight: bold; ">IS</span> Globalism?</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;Globalism is the ideology that all countries around the world should become more interconnected and
        dependent on each other. But what does this actually mean? In short: those who believe in the ideology think
        that
        the world would benefit from all countries relying on each other in some form or another whether that be through
        imports and exports, services, or protection. Globalisation takes many different forms as aforementioned with
        one
        of
        the most popular forms of globalisation is economic globalisation; it most often takes the form of increased
        trade
        dependencies between countries. Globalism has taken place throughout the entirety of human history with
        historical
        examples of it being Christopher Columbus discovering America, the silk and spice roads, etc. It has been more
        prominent in recent history with the industrial revolution playing a major role in the growth of globalisation.

        Globalism Affect our
        Lives?
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Globalisation has radically changed society throughout the course of recent history for both the better
        and the worse. The world as we know it would not exist without globalism. Without globalisation we would not
        have amenities like our clothing, cell phones, even the vehicles we drive would be drastically different. Many
        of the products we use on a daily basis would not be available to us as readily as they are today. World wide
        delivery used by businesses such as amazon is a direct result of globalisation and is only possible due to
        global interconnectedness.

        Furthermore, certain products would likely be more expensive than they are now such
        as clothing because the business models of companies like H&M would not be feasible. They would not be able to
        produce products cheaply in countries such as China and ship them to the US in a cheap manner. The vast majority
        of products available for purchase would become locally produced causing an increase in countries' domestic
        production. The global economy would cease to exist and organisations such as the WTO and World Bank would
        cease to exist meaning poorer countries would not have support from other wealthier countries.

        Despite all these
        benefits to our daily lives globalisation is not perfect and has led to an increase in transportation globally
        whether through personal use or other means, globalisation has led to a massive increase in greenhouse gas
        emissions leading to an increase in global warming along with an increase in air pollution. The
        industrialization resulting from globalisation is another major contributing factor to air pollution which
        further negatively impacts daily life.
